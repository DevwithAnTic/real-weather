# Real Weather

Real Weather is a simple, responsive weather application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It fetches weather data from external APIs and allows users to quickly view the "feels like" temperature for a specified city.

## Features

- **City Name Auto-correction:** Uses the [OpenStreetMap](https://nominatim.org) API to auto-correct city names.
- **Weather Data:** Retrieves current weather conditions from [wttr.in](https://wttr.in).
- **Dark/Light Mode:** Toggle between dark and light themes.
- **Responsive Design:** Smooth zooming background animation and adaptive layout.

## How It Works

1. **Enter a City:** Type the city name in the input field.
2. **Auto-correct:** The application uses the OpenStreetMap API to find the correct city name.
3. **Fetch Weather:** Weather data is fetched from wttr.in and displayed, including the feels-like temperature.
4. **Theme Toggle:** Switch between dark and light modes using the toggle button.

## Usage

1. Open the `Untitled-1` file in your browser or host it on a web server.
2. Enter a city name and press the "Get Weather" button (or press Enter) to view the weather details.

## Customization

Feel free to modify the HTML, CSS, or JavaScript in `Untitled-1` to suit your needs.
